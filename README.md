## Pre-Requisites ##
- **A Microsoft account:** A Microsoft account is required to access Microsoft services such as OneDrive, Xbox Live, Hotmail, Azure, etc.  If you have an @hotmail.com or @outlook.com email address then you already have a Microsoft account.  However, you do not need to have a Microsoft email address to have a Microsoft account.
